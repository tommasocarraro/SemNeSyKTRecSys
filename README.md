# SemNeSyKTRecSys
Semantic Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Transfer for Recommender Systems

## TODO list:
- better check wikidata categories to create the small dumps used to filter out unwanted matches
- code refactoring to put code in the right module
- google scraping should be improved by checking if the page is an Amazon page and include the ASIN in the URL
- queries should check against already available data
- inspect why certain queries are failing
- reject API matches if title overlap is too small
- fix api error handling with various cases
- improve type hints
- write comments
