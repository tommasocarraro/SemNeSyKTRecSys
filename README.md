# SemNeSyKTRecSys
Semantic Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Transfer for Recommender Systems

## TODO list:
- Figure out why google kg search for books is duplicating warning logs
- better check wikidata categories to create the small dumps used to filter out unwanted matches
- code refactoring to put code in the right module
- is it better to move to Neo4j?
- try to look for date before removing parentheses
- google scraping should be improved by checking if the page is an Amazon page and include the ASIN in the URL
